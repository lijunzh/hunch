## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 10 new rule fixture files from guessit: bonus, cd, common_words, country,
  date, film, language, part, size, website.
- All 22 fixture files now wired into Rust regression tests (was 12).
- `!!null` assertion support in regression test checker.
- 191 total Rust tests (140 unit + 22 regression + 27 integration + 2 doc-tests).

### Changed

- `validate_guessit.py` now reads from `tests/fixtures/` instead of
  requiring `../guessit` — fully self-contained, no external repo needed.
- Regression floors tightened to (actual − 2%) across all fixture files.

### Removed

- Dependency on external `../guessit` repository for testing.
